This is just a fun little project I made to see if I can replicate what Snowden said about passwords under 8 characters can be solved under a second.


Simply enter any code you would like my program to try unlock
and it'll display the password you entered, amount of attempts and the time in milliseconds.

Note: This obviously isn't a hack or anymeans. All it does is run every possible combination and compare it with the code entered.
