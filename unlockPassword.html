    <p>
        This is just a fun little project I made to see if I can replicate what Snowden said about 
        passwords under 8 characters can be solved under a second.<br><br></br>

        Simply enter any code you would like my program to try unlock <br>
        and it'll display the password you entered, amount of attempts and the time in milliseconds. <br><br>

        Note: This obviously isn't a hack or anymeans. All it does is run every possible combination and compare it with the code entered.
